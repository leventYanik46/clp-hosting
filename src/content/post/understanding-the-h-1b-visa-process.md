## **Understanding the H-1B Visa Process**

#### **A Practical Timeline..**

*By Capitol Law Partners* 

The H-1B visa is one of the most sought-after work permits for skilled professionals aiming to build their careers in the United States. Reserved for specialty occupations in fields like technology, engineering, finance, and healthcare, it allows U.S. employers to hire foreign talent when specialized expertise is required. 

While the opportunities are significant, the process is competitive, with a strict annual cap and a lottery system to determine who may apply. Understanding the timeline is essential for a smooth application — and avoiding missed deadlines. 




#### **Annual H-1B Timeline** 

The U.S. government’s fiscal year runs from **October 1 to September 30**, with the H-1B quota opening at the start of each fiscal year. The application process begins months in advance. 

##### **January – February: Preparation** 

This is when candidates and employers set the groundwork. The employer confirms sponsorship, and the applicant gathers essential documents such as diplomas, transcripts, and — if necessary — credential evaluations to confirm U.S. degree equivalency. 

##### **March: Online Lottery Registration** 

USCIS opens its online registration portal, typically in early March. Employers submit basic details about the applicant and pay a small registration fee. The registration window lasts around two weeks, followed by a lottery to determine which applicants can proceed. 

##### **April – June: Petition Filing** 

If selected, the employer files Form I-129 with USCIS, accompanied by a certified Labor Condition Application (LCA) from the Department of Labor. Premium Processing can speed up the decision to 15 days, while standard processing may take several months. 

##### **July – September: Approval & Visa Issuance** 

Applicants outside the U.S. attend a consular interview, while those already in the country can request a change of status. This is the final stage before the visa becomes active. 

##### **October 1: Employment Start Date** 

The new fiscal year begins, and approved H-1B workers can officially start employment under their visa status.
