## Work and Travel 2026: Expenses, What Students Want to Know 

### What is the Work and Travel Program? – Application Process, Visa, Fees, and Top Tips (2025 Guide) 

Work and Travel is a program that allows university students to both work and experience cultural exchange in the United States during the summer months. Ideal for improving English and discovering a different country, this program can become an unforgettable experience when planned correctly. However, proceeding without the right information can strain both your budget and the process. 

In this article, we will share advice based on experience, challenges encountered, and essential WAT tips you absolutely need to know. We have created a guide specifically for students applying for the first time. 

### Work and Travel Application Process – When to Apply? 

First of all, timing is critical. 

Registration generally opens in August–September. But remember, applying early always means more job options. 

**If you wait until January or later:** 

* The number of jobs may decrease 
* Popular and more beneficial positions may be filled 
* Available sponsor quotas may decrease 
* The visa process may become congested

**Tip:** 

The earlier you apply, the better your job, accommodation, and state will be. 

### Required GPA for Work and Travel

The generally required minimum GPA:  

👉 2.50 GPA 

Some people go with a lower GPA, but the three criteria most looked at for the visa are: 

* Your university 
* Your major 
* Your GPA 

 Students who are strong in these three areas have an advantage. 

**Tip:**

If your GPA is low, your English level and motivation are very important. Expressing yourself well in the interview can greatly help the process. 

### Company and Sponsor Selection – The Most Critical Decision 

Company in your country: The party that prepares your documents 

Sponsor: The official responsible party in the US 

*Your sponsor is the one who will step in if you encounter any problems. Therefore, choosing a reliable sponsor is very important.* 

 **Tip:** 

Before choosing a company, be sure to: 

* Check YouTube reviews 
* Check Instagram reviews 
* Check Google experiences 


Don't forget to take a look. 

### Work and Travel Fees – 2025 Current Expenses

Based on the 2025 general pricing, the average is as follows:

$500 → Registration fee (non-refundable)

$2,900 → Program fee

$180 → Visa fee

$35 → SEVIS fee 



➡️ Total: $3,200 (excluding airfare).

It's not a cheap program, but with proper planning, you can cover your expenses and even save a nice amount.

**Tip:**

Early registration, early payment, and student discounts can reduce many costs.

### Job Selection – Jobs Based on English Level 

If your English is low, you will generally be given jobs that do not require communication, such as dishwasher or housekeeping.

If your English is good, you have more options:

* Cashier
* Host/Hostess
* Barista
* Market employee

**Tip:**

If you want to practice your language skills, be sure to choose a job where you will communicate with customers. 

If you're focused on money, go for jobs that offer tips.

### Make a Decision... Money or Experience?

Before going to WAT, ask yourself this question:

👉 “Am I going to this program to earn money or for experience?”

Because your choice will determine:

* State
* Job
* Hourly wage 
* Overtime opportunities

will depend entirely on your answer to this question.

**Tip:**

If you want both money and socializing, the East Coast is best:

* New York
* New Jersey
* Vermont
* Massachusetts
* Pennsylvania

## The Visa Process Is Nothing to Fear

The visa interview **only takes 2 minutes**. 

Main questions asked: 

* What grade are you in? 
* What is your GPA? 
* What does your family do for a living? 
* Have you traveled abroad before? 
* Why this state/job? 

**Tip:** 

Freshmen and seniors are more likely to be rejected. 

The ideal time to apply is during your sophomore or junior year. 

#### Accommodation – One of the Most Important Issues 

Things to consider regarding accommodation: 

* Is the house close to the workplace? 
* Is there transportation? 
* How many people live in the house? 
* How is the room sharing? 
* Is the house secure? 

 **Tip:** 

Choosing a house is as important as choosing a job. The wrong house can ruin the whole experience. 

#### Meals and Working Conditions Tip:

Jobs that provide meals significantly reduce costs.

#### Airline Tickets – What is the Best Choice?

Some airlines offer discounted direct flights for students, so do your research and take advantage of them. 

For connecting flights: 

* Time loss 
* Lost luggage 
* Exhausting journeys 

Such factors can ruin your trip. 

**Tip:** 

If you are traveling abroad for the first time, always choose a direct flight.
