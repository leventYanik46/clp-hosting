### **What Is the B-1/B-2 Visa?**Â 

The **B-1/B-2 visa** is a **non-immigrant, temporary visitor visa** that allows foreign nationals to enter the U.S. for short stays.Â 

* **B-1 Visa (Business Visitor):** For business-related activities such as meetings, conferences, contract negotiations, or professional training.Â 
* **B-2 Visa (Tourist Visitor):** For tourism, vacation, family visits, or medical treatment.Â 

In practice, most applicants receive a **combined B-1/B-2 visa**, allowing both business and tourism activities during their stay.Â 

##### **Key Eligibility Requirements**Â 

To qualify, applicants must demonstrate:Â 

* **Purpose of Visit:** Clear business or tourism-related reasons.Â 
* **Temporary Stay:** Proof that the visit is temporary (usually up to 6 months).Â 
* **Ties to Home Country:** Evidence of strong social, economic, or family ties ensuring return after the visit.Â 
* **Financial Support:** Ability to cover travel and living expenses in the U.S.Â 

#### **What You Cannot Do on a B-1/B-2 Visa**Â 

It is important to note that the B-1/B-2 visa does **not** allow:Â 

* Employment in the United States.Â 
* Enrollment in long-term academic programs.Â 
* Permanent residency or adjustment of status without changing visa categories.Â 

**The Application Process**Â 

* **Form DS-160:** Complete the online non-immigrant visa application.Â 
* **Visa Fee & Appointment:** Pay the fee and schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate.Â 
* **Interview & Documentation:** Present supporting documents (travel purpose, financial proof, ties to home country).Â 
* **Visa Decision:** If approved, the B-1/B-2 visa is typically issued for multiple entries, valid for several years depending on nationality.Â 
* **Common Challenges**Â 
* **Demonstrating Intent to Return:** Applicants often face scrutiny about whether they plan to overstay.Â 
* **Incomplete Documentation:** Missing financial records or unclear travel purpose can lead to denial.Â
