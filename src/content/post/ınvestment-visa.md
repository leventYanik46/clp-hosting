# Investment Visa (EB-5 / E-2): Pathways to U.S. Residency Through Investment

**KnoHow Blog**

Are you considering moving to the United States through investment? The U.S. offers two key visa pathways designed for foreign investors: the **EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa** and the **E-2 Treaty Investor Visa**. Both provide opportunities to live and work in the U.S., but they serve different purposes and come with distinct requirements. In this article, we break down everything you need to know about the EB-5 and E-2 visas.




## What is the EB-5 Visa?




The **EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program** offers a route to U.S. permanent residency (Green Card) through a significant financial investment in a U.S.-based commercial enterprise that creates jobs for American workers. The minimum investment required is $800,000 if directed into a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) or $1.05 million in other locations. Applicants may invest directly in their own business or through a USCIS-designated Regional Center. One of the program's key benefits is that it grants a direct path to lawful permanent residence for the investor, their spouse, and unmarried children under 21. However, EB-5 is not without challenges—it involves a lengthy application process that can take over two years, and the investment is inherently at risk, as it must be committed to an active business that fulfills job creation requirements.







## What is the E-2 Visa?

The **E-2 Treaty Investor Visa** allows individuals from countries that maintain a treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States to enter and work in the U.S. based on an investment in a U.S. enterprise. There is no official minimum investment amount, but in practice, a substantial investment typically starts from $100,000 or more, depending on the nature of the business. The investor must control at least 50% of the business, and the enterprise must be real, active, and generating more than marginal income. One major advantage of the E-2 visa is its speed—it is often processed within weeks or a few months and can be renewed indefinitely as long as the business remains operational. However, the E-2 does not offer a direct path to a Green Card, and it is only available to nationals of treaty countries, which limits eligibility for some investors.

### Which Visa is Right for You? 

Deciding between the EB-5 and E-2 visa depends on your goals, resources, and timeline. If your primary objective is to obtain a Green Card and you have the financial means to invest over $800,000, the EB-5 visa offers a direct route to permanent residency. On the other hand, if you're from a treaty country and want to quickly establish a business with a lower investment threshold, the E-2 visa can be a highly flexible and renewable option—though it does not guarantee permanent status. In some cases, investors begin with the E-2 visa and later transition to EB-5 or other immigrant visa categories.









* **Choose EB-5 if**: You're looking for permanent U.S. residency and can invest a higher amount.




* **Choose E-2 if**: You’re from a treaty country, want to start a business, and prefer a lower-risk, lower-cost option with quicker entry.
