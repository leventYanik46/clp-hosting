## Permanent Resident (Green) Card and Immigrant Visas

### What Is a Green Card?

#### What is a Green Card and what are immigrant visas? 

The United States offers several pathways for foreign nationals who wish to live, work, and build a future in the country permanently. Two key concepts in this process are the Permanent Resident (Green) Card and immigrant visas. Understanding how these systems work is essential before starting any immigration application.

### What Is a Green Card?

A Green Card, officially known as a Permanent Resident Card, grants an individual the legal right to live and work permanently in the United States. Green Card holders are considered lawful permanent residents and can benefit from many rights similar to U.S. citizens, such as employment freedom and access to education. After meeting certain requirements, Green Card holders may also become eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship.



### What Are Immigrant Visas?

Immigrant visas are visas issued to individuals who intend to live permanently in the United States. Unlike non-immigrant visas, which are temporary, immigrant visas are specifically designed for long-term or permanent residence. Once an immigrant visa holder enters the U.S., they can apply for or automatically receive permanent resident status.



### Types of Immigrant Visas

There are several categories of immigrant visas, each based on a specific eligibility pathway:



* Family-Based Immigrant Visas: For close relatives of U.S. citizens or permanent residents.

* Employment-Based Immigrant Visas: For individuals sponsored by U.S. employers or those with extraordinary abilities.

* Diversity Visa (Green Card Lottery): A program that provides visas to individuals from countries with low immigration rates to the U.S.

* Investor and Business-Based Visas: For individuals who make qualifying investments or establish businesses in the U.S.

* Special Immigrant Categories: Including religious workers, international organization employees, and other specific groups.




### Why Legal Guidance Matters

The Green Card and immigrant visa process involves strict eligibility rules, detailed documentation, and long processing times. Even small mistakes can lead to delays or denials. Working with experienced immigration professionals helps ensure applications are accurate, compliant, and strategically prepared.
