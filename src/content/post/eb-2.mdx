## Overview

The EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) allows advanced-degree professionals or individuals of exceptional ability to self-petition for U.S. permanent residency by proving their work serves the national interest. Unlike other employment-based visas, it bypasses the labor certification process—but requires a highly persuasive petition.
