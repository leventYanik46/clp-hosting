# DV Lottery Program Temporarily Suspended!

## 
Is this a permanent cancellation?

##### Are there any other migration options available?

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced the temporary suspension of the Diversity Visa (DV) Green Card Lottery program. This decision is a temporary suspension under an administrative regulation, not a permanent cancellation.

This development may cause delays in the DV Lottery process; however, it does not mean the end of dreams of living and working in the U.S.



### The DV1 program has been canceled indefinitely. 

**The Green Card lottery (DV-1), also known as the US Diversity Visa (DV) Program, has been temporarily suspended following instructions from US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. The suspension of the program has been officially announced.**



#### Are there any other migration options available?

📌 Besides the DV Lottery, there are still valid and strong immigration options available:

• E-2 Investor Visa

• O-1 Exceptional Ability Visa

• EB-1A

• EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)

Every applicant's situation is different, and there is no single solution for the US residency process. Many factors influence the choice of application path, including educational background, professional experience, family situation, and long-term goals. Therefore, the key is to identify the most suitable and sustainable immigration path for your current circumstances with the right strategy and to manage the process consciously.
