## **Crimmigration: Where Criminal Law Meets Immigration Law** 

#### **Understanding the Complex Intersection of Crime and Immigration in the United States** 

Crimmigration—short for *criminal law + immigration law*—has become one of the fastest-growing areas of U.S. legal practice. It describes the overlap between criminal charges and their immigration consequences. For non-citizens, even a seemingly minor criminal matter can lead to deportation, denial of a green card, or loss of immigration benefits. 

At **[Capitol Law Partners](https://capitollawpartners.com/)**, we provide guidance and representation to individuals, families, and businesses facing these complex issues. Our goal is to protect your rights, secure your status, and help you move forward. 

 

#### **What Is Crimmigration?** 

Crimmigration arises when a non-citizen is accused of or convicted of a crime that may affect their immigration status. U.S. immigration law treats certain offenses—sometimes even misdemeanors—as grounds for removal (deportation). 

**Examples include:** 

* A lawful permanent resident arrested for possession of a controlled substance. 
* A student visa holder charged with shoplifting. 
* An undocumented worker accused of a traffic-related offense leading to detention. 

While in criminal court, a defendant may focus on avoiding jail time, in immigration court the same case could trigger **inadmissibility** or **removal proceedings**. This double exposure makes crimmigration uniquely challenging. 

 

#### **Why It Matters** 

Many immigrants believe that once a criminal matter is resolved in state court, the issue is behind them. Unfortunately, this is not always true. Immigration authorities can use past arrests, pleas, or convictions against you—even if you received probation or a suspended sentence. 

For example: 

\-A plea deal to a lesser offense may still count as a “crime involving moral turpitude” under immigration law. 

\-A conviction for domestic violence, even if minor under state law, can result in deportation. 

\-A DUI charge combined with immigration violations could lead to mandatory detention. 

The stakes are high: **freedom, family unity, and the right to remain in the U.S.** 

 

#### **Common Immigration Consequences of Criminal Charges** 

**Deportation (Removal Proceedings)** 

 Even long-time green card holders can face deportation if convicted of certain crimes. 

**Inadmissibility** 

 Criminal records may bar individuals from obtaining visas, green cards, or U.S. citizenship. 

**Mandatory Detention** 

 Non-citizens with certain charges can be held in detention without the possibility of release on bond. 

**Loss of Immigration Benefits** 

 Criminal history may prevent eligibility for relief programs like DACA, asylum, or adjustment of status. 

 

#### **The Role of an Attorney in Crimmigration Cases** 

Because criminal defense attorneys and immigration attorneys often operate in separate worlds, many clients do not receive advice that considers both systems. At **Capitol Law Partners**, we bridge that gap. 

We: 

* **Advise on immigration-safe pleas** before a criminal case is resolved. 
* **Defend clients in removal proceedings** when criminal charges trigger deportation. 
* **Negotiate outcomes** that minimize immigration consequences. 
* **Provide long-term strategy**, such as post-conviction relief or waivers, when past charges threaten your future. 

 

#### **Case Example** 

Imagine a lawful permanent resident who has lived in the U.S. for 15 years. They are charged with shoplifting a $50 item. In state court, this may appear to be a minor matter resulting in probation. But in immigration law, it could be treated as a crime involving moral turpitude, making the individual deportable. 

With skilled legal counsel, it may be possible to negotiate a plea to a lesser, non-deportable offense—protecting both their record and their immigration status.
