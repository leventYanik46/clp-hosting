### **Family-Based Immigration: A Path to Permanent Residency in the U.S.**  

#### **Who Is Eligible for Family-Based Immigrant Visas?** 

There are two primary categories: 

**Immediate Relative (IR) Visas** – Unlimited in number and reserved for close relatives of U.S. citizens: 

1. IR1/CR1: Spouse 
2. IR2: Unmarried child under 21 
3. IR5: Parent 

**Family Preference (F) Visas** – Limited in number and subject to annual quotas. Includes: 

1. F1: Unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens 
2. F2A/F2B: Spouses and children of lawful permanent residents 
3. F3: Married children of U.S. citizens 
4. F4: Siblings of U.S. citizens 

### **How to Apply for Permanent Residency for a Family Member** 

To help a family member immigrate, both the sponsor and the applicant must follow a multi-step process: 

**\*If your relative is in the U.S.:** Apply through **Adjustment of Status** using **Form I-485**. 

**\*If your relative is abroad:** Follow **Consular Processing**, which includes filing Form I-130, NVC review, and completing **Form DS-260** at the U.S. Embassy. 

#### **Financial Requirements: Affidavit of Support (Form I-864)** 

U.S. immigration law requires sponsors to accept financial responsibility for the relatives they are sponsoring. This is done through **Form I-864, Affidavit of Support**. 

\*The sponsor must show income of at least **125% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines** based on household size. 

\*If the sponsored immigrant receives public benefits (such as Medicaid or SNAP), the government can legally seek reimbursement from the sponsor. 

\*This form is legally enforceable and is a required part of **all family-based Green Card applications**. 

If the sponsor's income is insufficient, a **joint sponsor** or proof of assets may be required.
