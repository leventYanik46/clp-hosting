## Establishing a Company in America

Establishing a company in America is a significant opportunity for entrepreneurs who want to conduct international trade, generate income in foreign currency, and expand into the global market. There is no requirement to be an American citizen or residency holder to establish a company in the US. Therefore, many entrepreneurs from Turkey and other countries choose to establish companies in America.



### Can Foreign Nationals Establish a Company in America?

Yes. Foreign nationals can establish a company in America even if they are not US citizens or Green Card holders. Physical presence in the US is not required to establish a company, and procedures can be completed remotely. However, establishing a company does not automatically grant residency or visa rights. For those aiming for immigration, it is crucial that the company structure is compatible with their visa type. 

### Documents Required to Form a Company in the United States

The following information and documents are generally required during the company formation process in the United States:

* Company owner's passport information
* Address information in the country of residence
* Trade name to be chosen for the company
* Brief description of the company's field of activity
* Contact information of the company owner
* Authorized person information (sole proprietor or partnership structure)

After the company is established, additional documents may be requested for opening a bank account, obtaining a tax identification number, and setting up payment systems.

### Company Type and Structure

The most commonly preferred company type in the United States is the LLC (Limited Liability Company). The LLC structure offers a flexible management model and the advantage of limited liability. Choosing the right company type plays a critical role in terms of tax obligations and future immigration plans. 

## The Aid of Legal Support in the Process

Although the process of forming a company in the United States is accessible, incorrect structuring can lead to problems in tax, banking transactions, and immigration processes in later stages. Especially for foreign nationals, company formation must be done within the legal framework and with the right strategy. 

Capitol Law Partners provides professional legal advice to foreign entrepreneurs seeking to establish companies in the United States, assisting with company structure, legal compliance, and planning aligned with immigration goals.
