## **J-1 Visa: Exchange Visitor Program Participants Update – 2025** 

JThe J-1 Visa is still among the most useful non-immigrant visas for cultural, educational, and professional exchange in the US. 2025 – Many AORs face a new legal world, following earlier legal reforms where Turkey was removed from the EV Skills List. If you are a student, researcher, teacher, or professional, it’s important to know about the J-1 structure in order to have all the information you need to make an informed decision about your U.S. stay.

This guide, prepared by **[Capitol Law Partners](https://capitollawpartners.com/)**, provides a comprehensive breakdown of the J-1 visa: from its basic requirements to recent updates, including extensions, work rights, family benefits, and the critical two-year home residency rule. 

Core Features

The J-1 visa is designed to foster mutual understanding between the United States and other countries through educational and cultural exchange. It spans a wide variety of topics, including:

\-Students and researchers: university exchanges, post-docs, guest lecturers.

\-Interns and Trainees: Designed to provide practical training programs for international businesses.

\-Teachers: Nonresident teachers to travel to the United States to teach.

\-Au Pair, Camp Counselor: Cultural exchange with childcare both for camp or summer.

\-Specific Programmes: Graduate medical trainees, government visitors and short-term scholars.

A critical element of the J-1 visa is **sponsorship**. Independent applications are not possible—every applicant must be sponsored by an organization authorized by the U.S. Department of State. Without a sponsor, no DS-2019 form can be issued, and without DS-2019, a visa application cannot be filed. 

Applicants must also register in **SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System)** and pay the **I-901 fee (220 USD)** to maintain compliance. SEVIS is the electronic tracking system used by the U.S. government to monitor all exchange visitors. 

### **Application Process** 

The J-1 application involves several formal steps, each with legal significance: 

**1.Find a Sponsor** 
 The applicant must secure an invitation or placement through a recognized sponsor—universities, cultural institutions, or specialized private programs. Each sponsor has its own criteria, program rules, and costs. 

**2.Obtain the DS-2019 Form** 
 This form, officially titled *Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status*, details the purpose, length, and conditions of your program. 

**3.Pay the SEVIS I-901 Fee** 
 Proof of payment is mandatory before scheduling a consular interview. 

**4.Complete the DS-160 Form** 
 This online non-immigrant visa application includes detailed biographical, security, and travel information. 

**5. Schedule and Attend a Visa Interview** 
 At the U.S. Embassy or Consulate, applicants must demonstrate ties to their home country, proof of sponsorship, and sufficient financial resources. 

The interview stage is critical: consular officers assess not only eligibility but also the applicant’s intent to comply with visa conditions, particularly the obligation to return home if subject to the **212(e) residency rule**. 

Work and Study Rights

The J-1 is not a general work visa. Only program rights are connected to employment. For example:

* An intern is only able to work for the host company, which is indicated in the DS-2019.
* A postdoc can be paid a salary by the host institute, but may not accept private employment.
* An Au Pair can take care of children as part of the cultural exchange program, but not other jobs.

J-1 visa holders, unlike F-1 students, are not eligible to work campus jobs or pursue Optional Practical Training (OPT). Violating work restrictions can lead to SEVIS termination and visa revocation. 

Some categories, particularly **physicians** and **professors**, may face added scrutiny and restrictions given the sensitive nature of their roles. 

### **The 212(e) Two-Year Home Residency Requirement** 

One of the most debated features of the J-1 visa is the **two-year home residency requirement**. Certain participants must return to their home country for at least two years after completing their program before they can apply for H-1B, L-1, or permanent residency (Green Card). 

This applies in three situations: 

\-The program is funded by the U.S. or foreign government. 

\-The applicant’s field of study or expertise is on their country’s **Exchange Visitor Skills List**. 

\-The program involves graduate medical training in the United States. 

#### **Waiver Options** 

Not all is lost if subject to 212(e). Waivers may be requested under specific conditions, including: 

* **No Objection Statement**: Issued by the participant’s home government stating they do not object to the individual remaining in the U.S. 
* **Exceptional Hardship**: If returning home would cause undue hardship to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse/child. 
* **Persecution**: If the applicant can demonstrate they would face persecution upon return. 
* **Interested U.S. Government Agency (IGA) Waiver**: If a U.S. agency has an interest in the individual staying. 

These processes are highly technical and require careful legal planning. 

### **Duration and Grace Period** 

The program duration is clearly stated on the DS-2019 form: 

\-Internships typically last **up to 12 months**. 

\-Au Pair programs last **one year** with possible extensions. 

\-Research scholars and professors may stay **up to five years**. 

After program completion, participants are usually granted a **30-day grace period** to prepare for departure or travel within the U.S. Employment during this grace period is prohibited. Overstaying can jeopardize future visa eligibility. 

### **Dependents (J-2)** 

Spouses and children may accompany the J-1 visa holder under **J-2 status**. The benefits are considerable: 

\-J-2 dependents can apply for an **Employment Authorization Document (EAD)**, allowing them to work in any field once approved. 

\-They may also enroll in U.S. schools or universities without needing an F-1 student visa. 

This flexibility makes the J-1 an attractive option for families who want both cultural immersion and professional opportunities. 

##### **Advantages and Disadvantages** 

**Advantages** 

\-Access to structured, prestigious U.S. exchange programs. 

\-Valuable cultural and professional experience. 

\-Work opportunities for spouses through J-2 EAD. 

**Disadvantages** 

\-Potential restrictions under the 212(e) rule. 

\-Limited employment rights compared to F-1 or H-1B. 

\-Program duration strictly controlled by sponsor, with little room for flexibility. 

Ultimately, the J-1 is best suited for **temporary cultural and professional enrichment**. It is not, on its own, a direct path to permanent immigration but can be strategically used as part of a longer immigration plan. 

### **1. Extending a J-1 Visa** 

Extensions depend heavily on sponsor approval. Participants must initiate the process **well before the DS-2019 expiration date**. Reasons may include completing a research project or continuing professional training. Processing times can take weeks, and approval is never guaranteed. 

### **2. Filing a Request with USCIS** 

In some situations, extensions or changes of status may require filing directly with **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)**. This step involves stricter review and potential risks, making legal guidance highly advisable. 

#### **3. 2024–2025 Update: Turkey Removed from the Skills List** 

On **December 9, 2024**, the U.S. Department of State updated the **Exchange Visitor Skills List**, and Turkey was officially removed. This change has major implications: 

\-Many Turkish participants are no longer automatically subject to the **two-year home residency rule**. 

\-Transitioning to H-1B, L-1, or even applying for permanent residency is now easier for many categories. 

However, not all restrictions are gone. Government-funded programs and medical training still trigger the 212(e) rule. Misinterpreting this exemption could cause serious legal consequences, making professional consultation critical.
