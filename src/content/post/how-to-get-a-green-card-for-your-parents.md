# How to Get a Green Card for Your Parents

One of the most common questions U.S. citizens ask after obtaining their citizenship is:

## *Can I apply for a Green Card for my parents?*

The answer is yes—but only under specific conditions, and the process needs to be handled carefully.

When managed correctly, the process of obtaining a Green Card for your parents can be fairly straightforward. However, there are many common misunderstandings about who is eligible to apply, where the application should be filed, and how the process actually works.

First and foremost, it is important to be very clear about one key rule: only U.S. citizens are eligible to file Green Card applications for their parents. Lawful Permanent Residents (Green Card holders) do *not* have the right to sponsor their parents. This is one of the most frequently misunderstood aspects of parent sponsorship.

## Eligibility Requirements for Sponsoring Parents

In addition to being a U.S. citizen, the sponsoring child must be at least 21 years old. The age requirement can sometimes cause confusion. What matters is not “approaching” 21, but actually having turned 21. In other words, once a U.S. citizen celebrates their 21st birthday, they become legally eligible to apply for Green Cards for their parents.

Another important point is that applications for parents are filed separately. There is no single combined application for both parents. A separate petition must be filed for the mother and the father, which makes proper planning from the beginning especially important.

## Where Should the Parents Be Located? (U.S. or Abroad?)

How the process moves forward depends largely on where the parents are physically located at the time of filing.

If the parents are living in Turkey, the process begins in the United States. The U.S. citizen child files an immigrant petition with USCIS. Once the petition is approved, the case is transferred to the National Visa Center (NVC). After the required documents are submitted and reviewed, an interview is scheduled at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. Following a successful interview, an immigrant visa is placed in the parent’s passport, allowing them to enter the United States as permanent residents.

## If the Parents Are Already in the United States

If the parents are already in the U.S., the entire process may be completed from within the country. Entering on a tourist visa, holding another legal status, or even being out of status does not automatically prevent eligibility. The most critical requirement is that the parents entered the U.S. lawfully.

In these cases, the immigrant petition and the Adjustment of Status application may be filed simultaneously, allowing the parents to transition to permanent resident status without leaving the United States.

## Is Applying for a Green Card Always the Right Choice for Parents on a Tourist Visa?

This is a very important consideration. Applying for a Green Card is not always the best strategy for every family. Some parents do not intend to live permanently in the United States and prefer to visit only for short periods as tourists.

Because Green Card holders are expected to spend a certain amount of time in the U.S., permanent residence may not be practical for parents who wish to maintain their primary life abroad.

## Tax and Financial Considerations

It is also important to remember that once parents receive a Green Card, they become subject to U.S. tax laws. For retired parents with limited income, this is often not a significant issue. However, for parents with substantial income or assets, the tax implications should be carefully evaluated in advance.

## Travel Restrictions During U.S.-Based Applications

One critical issue in U.S.-based applications is travel restriction. After filing, parents generally cannot leave the United States until they receive Advance Parole (travel authorization). Currently, this travel document may take 8–12 months, and in some cases even longer.

If this is not clearly discussed beforehand, parents may feel unexpectedly “stuck” in the United States, which can cause stress and frustration.

## Do Siblings Benefit From a Parent Green Card Application?

Finally, it is important to clarify that Green Card applications filed for parents do not include siblings. Minor siblings are not covered under a parent sponsorship case. Sponsoring siblings requires a separate immigration process, which typically involves significantly longer waiting times.

In summary, sponsoring parents for a Green Card is a powerful benefit of U.S. citizenship—but it is not automatically the right option for every family. Both the legal requirements and the practical, long-term consequences must be carefully considered before moving forward.
