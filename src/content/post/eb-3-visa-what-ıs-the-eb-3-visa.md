## **Understanding the EB-3 Visa**

For many professionals and workers around the world, the United States represents a place of opportunity, growth, and long-term stability. Among the employment-based immigrant visa options, the **EB-3 visa** is one of the most common routes to obtaining a U.S. Green Card. At *Capitol Law Partners*, we help clients navigate the complexities of immigration law to secure their future in America. 

### **What Is the EB-3 Visa?** 

The **EB-3 visa** is an employment-based immigrant visa that grants lawful permanent residency (Green Card) to foreign nationals who meet specific job and skill requirements. Unlike the EB-1 and EB-2 categories, EB-3 is generally more accessible but comes with longer waiting times due to higher demand. 

#### **Who Qualifies for EB-3?** 

The EB-3 category is divided into three subgroups: 

* **Skilled Workers** – Individuals with at least **two years of work experience or training** in a specialized field. 
* **Professionals** – Applicants with a **U.S. bachelor’s degree (or foreign equivalent)** working in a position that requires such a degree. 
* **Other Workers (Unskilled Workers)** – Individuals performing **unskilled labor** requiring less than two years of training or experience. 

This flexibility makes EB-3 a popular option for both employers seeking talent and workers aspiring to build a future in the U.S. 

**Key Requirements** 

**\-Job Offer**: Applicants must have a permanent, full-time job offer from a U.S. employer. 

**\-Labor Certification (PERM)**: The employer must prove that no qualified U.S. workers are available for the position. 

**\-Education/Experience**: Proof of qualifications (degree, training, or work history) must match the position offered. 

**The Application Process** 

Applying for EB-3 involves multiple steps, and precise documentation is critical: 

1. **PERM Labor Certification** – Employer obtains certification from the Department of Labor. 
2. **I-140 Immigrant Petition** – Employer files Form I-140 with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). 
3. **Adjustment of Status or Consular Processing** – Applicant applies for a Green Card either in the U.S. or through a U.S. consulate abroad. 

Processing times can vary, and in some countries, visa backlogs can lead to waiting periods of several years. 

**Advantages and Challenges** 

**Advantages:** 

* Provides a direct route to permanent residency. 
* Available to a wide range of professionals and workers. 

**Challenges:** 

* Requires employer sponsorship. 
* Longer waiting times compared to EB-1 and EB-2 categories. 
* PERM process can be complex and time-sensitive.
