### **The Fastest Ways to Get a Green Card in the U.S.**

 

For those who are undocumented in the U.S. and want to obtain a Green Card quickly, there are several possible options. However, not everyone qualifies for every method. That’s why, at the end of this article, we also include a “bonus option” that, although slower, may apply to a wider group of people. 

 

Not all application routes are processed at the same speed; while some methods may lead to a Green Card within 1–2 years, others can take more than 10 years. In this guide, we break down the fastest ways to get a Green Card in the U.S. step by step and explain in detail who can benefit from which option. 

 

### **How to Get a Green Card — and How to Do It Fast?** 

 Let’s find out. 

 

### **1. Green Card Through Marriage** 

\-The fastest way is marrying a U.S. citizen. 

\-Although USCIS backlogs and requests for additional evidence can extend the timeline, on average a Green Card can be obtained within 10–24 months. 

\-The marriage must be with a U.S. citizen, not a Green Card holder. 

\-You must be physically present in the U.S. and have entered legally. 

\-If you apply from outside the U.S., the process can take much longer. 

 

### **2. Being an Immediate Relative of a U.S. Citizen** 

\-If you are the parent of a U.S. citizen or an unmarried child under 21, you are considered an “immediate relative.” 

\-In this case, you can usually receive a Green Card within 1–2 years without waiting for the visa bulletin. 

\-For other relatives (siblings, adult children), the process is much longer and usually requires consular processing outside the U.S. 

 

### **3. EB-1A Extraordinary Ability Visa** 

\-Available for individuals with extraordinary ability in arts, science, business, or sports. 

\-Once approved, a Green Card may be obtained within 1–2 years. 

\-No employer sponsorship is required, but you must meet at least 3 of the 10 criteria that prove “extraordinary ability.” 

 

#### **4. EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW)** 

\-For individuals working on projects that are important and beneficial to the U.S. (e.g., developing new medical treatments, AI software). 

\-The process can take 1–2 years. 

\-Legal entry and valid immigration status are required.

### **5. Asylum** 

\-Intended for individuals who fear returning to their home country. 

\-The application must be filed within 1 year of entering the U.S. 

\-The process can take many years, sometimes even over a decade. 

Note: It used to be a relatively fast option, but now there may be over 1 million pending applications — and the backlog continues to grow. 

 

### **6. Parole in Place for Military Families** 

\-Applies to spouses, parents, or unmarried children of current or former U.S. military members. 

\-After approval, a Green Card can be obtained in about 16–18 months. 

 

### **7. VAWA (Violence Against Women Act)** 

\-Applicable not only to women, but also to men, children, and parents. 

\-Those who have suffered abuse (physical or emotional) from a U.S. citizen spouse, parent, or child may apply. 

\-On average, the process takes about 3.5 years. 

\-No legal entry or immigration status is required — applications can be filed from within the U.S.
