## U.S. Immigration Update 2025: How Proposed Rules Affect F-1 Students and Scholars

In August 2025, the Trump Administration reintroduced a proposal that could significantly alter how foreign students, professors, physicians, and media representatives remain in the United States. If finalized, this rule would eliminate the long-standing “duration of status” (D/S) framework and replace it with fixed admission periods. For international students, this marks one of the most substantial immigration shifts in decades. 

At **[Capitol Law Partners](https://capitollawpartners.com)**, we closely monitor these developments to help individuals and institutions understand their legal rights and obligations under U.S. immigration law. 

 

### **What Is Changing Under the Proposed Rule?** 

**\-End of “Duration of Status”:** Since 1978, F-1 students were allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely as long as they remained enrolled. The new rule would end this practice. 

**\-Fixed Admission Periods:** Students and exchange visitors would be admitted for the length of their program, capped at **four years**. 

**\-Extension Requirements:** To remain longer, individuals would need to file for extensions with **USCIS**, triggering more frequent government review. 

**\-Impact on Media Representatives:** Foreign journalists would be limited to **240 days**, with possible extensions of the same length. 

 

### **Why Is This Rule Being Proposed?** 

According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the purpose is to: 

\-Prevent individuals from becoming “perpetual students” in the U.S. 

\-Enhance national security by ensuring regular vetting. 

\-Reduce the administrative burden of tracking visa holders who remain for extended periods. 

While DHS emphasizes safety and oversight, critics argue that such changes could discourage international talent and strain U.S. universities reliant on foreign student enrollment. 

 

### **What This Means for International Students** 

**\-Shorter Planning Horizons:** Students must now factor in fixed timelines when planning their education. 

**\-Increased Paperwork:** More frequent USCIS filings mean higher costs and administrative hurdles. 

**\-Potential Visa Uncertainty:** Even high-achieving students may face challenges if extension requests are delayed or denied. 

For U.S. institutions, the rule may create additional compliance responsibilities under **SEVP** and **SEVIS** monitoring systems.
