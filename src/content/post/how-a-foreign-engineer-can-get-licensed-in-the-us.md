# How a Foreign Engineer Can Get Licensed in the US | Step by Step



Engineering is one of the most regulated professions in the United States. For foreign-trained engineers, earning a U.S. engineering license (Professional Engineer – *PE License*) is essential for career advancement, higher earning potential, and the legal authorization to sign and seal engineering documents. This process, however, includes several steps—evaluations, exams, visa procedures, and state board requirements—each of which can be complex.

Capitol Law Partners has extensive experience assisting foreign professionals in navigating U.S. immigration and licensing pathways. This guide explains the full process and highlights how professional legal support can make your journey significantly smoother.

## 1. Understanding the US Engineering Licensing System

In the United States, engineering licenses are regulated at the state level. This means every state has its own engineering board and its own licensing requirements. However, the licensing steps are generally similar across the country:



1. Credential Evaluation (Education Review)

2. FE Exam (Fundamentals of Engineering)

3. Gaining Required Work Experience

4. PE Exam (Professional Engineering Exam)

5. Application & State Registration


Foreign engineers must complete these steps regardless of previous experience or licensing abroad. However, many states recognize foreign engineering degrees after a formal evaluation.

## 2. Step One: Credential Evaluation

Before any exam or application, foreign-trained engineers must have their degrees evaluated by an approved evaluation service, such as:

* NCEES Credentials Evaluation

* ECE (Educational Credential Evaluators)

* WES (World Education Services)


This evaluation determines whether your degree is equivalent to an ABET-accredited U.S. engineering program.

**If deficiencies exist:**

Some state boards may require additional coursework. Knowing this early prevents delays, which is why proper planning is crucial.



## 3. Step Two: Taking the FE Exam (Fundamentals of Engineering)

The FE Exam is typically the first major milestone.

It:

* Tests foundational engineering knowledge

* Is computer-based

* Is offered year-round

* Must be passed before applying for the PE License


After passing the FE, you become an Engineer-in-Training (EIT) or Engineering Intern (EI).



## 4. Step Three: Gaining Required Work Experience

To become a PE, most states require 3–4 years of engineering experience under a licensed PE.

Foreign experience may count partially but is often limited.

Most state boards prefer U.S.-based supervised experience.


This step is heavily tied to your immigration status, making visa planning essential.



## 5. Step Four: Taking the PE Exam (Professional Engineer Exam)



The PE Exam is the final and most important step. It:

* Requires advanced engineering knowledge

* Is discipline-specific (Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, etc.)

* Can only be taken after meeting the state’s education + experience requirements.

Once passed, you can apply directly to the state board for full licensure



## 6. Required Visa Options for Foreign Engineers

To complete FE/PE requirements and work legally in the U.S., foreign engineers must obtain an appropriate visa. The most common visa categories are:



## H-1B Visa (Specialty Occupations)

The most common visa for foreign engineers.


Requirements:

* A U.S. employer sponsor

* A bachelor’s degree or higher in engineering

* Job duties that require engineering expertise


Capitol Law Partners routinely handles H-1B filings and compliance for engineering professionals.

### 
TN Visa (For Canadian & Mexican Citizens)

Under USMCA, engineers from Canada and Mexico can obtain a TN visa quickly.


Advantages:

* Fast processing
* Renewable indefinitely
* No annual lottery


## EB-2 / EB-3 Employment-Based Green Cards

Ideal for engineers seeking permanent residency.

### 
EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)


Perfect for engineers with:

* Advanced degrees

* Strong technical background

* Contributions to U.S. infrastructure or innovation


*Does not require employer sponsorship.*



## O-1 Visa (Extraordinary Ability in Engineering)

For engineers with exceptional achievements:

* Patents
* Major industry awards
* High-impact publications
* Recognized innovation


## F-1 Student Visa (For Those Planning to Study Before Licensing)

Some engineers choose to pursue:

* A master’s degree

* Additional coursework

* FE exam preparation programs


F-1 students may work under OPT/CPT after graduation, gaining U.S. experience required for PE licensure.



# 7. The Role of Capitol Law Partners in Your Licensing & Visa Process



The journey from foreign engineer to licensed U.S. engineer involves regulation, documentation, exams, immigration steps, and timing management.

Even small mistakes—incorrect credential evaluation, poorly structured visa applications, missing documents—can cause months or even years of delay.




### Capitol Law Partners provides full-process guidance, including:



* Identifying the correct visa category (H-1B, TN, EB-2 NIW, O-1, etc.)

* Preparing and filing immigration petitions

* Reviewing your academic credentials for licensing compatibility

* Advising on state board requirements

* Coordinating timelines for FE, PE, and visa processing

* Supporting you through RFE responses or appeals

* Ensuring your immigration status aligns with licensing eligibility


### Why Professional Legal Guidance Matters

* U.S. licensure and visa systems operate independently but affect each other

* Employers prefer candidates with clean, well-managed cases

* Immigration timelines directly influence exam eligibility and job opportunities

* Mistakes can lead to denials, delays, or loss of status


A professionally managed process ensures that every step—licensing, employment, and immigration—works together efficiently.
