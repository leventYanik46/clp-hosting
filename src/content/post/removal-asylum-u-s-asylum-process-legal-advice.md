# I-589 Form & U.S. Asylum Process Explained – Expert Immigration Consultation

If you are seeking asylum in the United States, you must file an asylum application. As an applicant, you need to prove that you have been persecuted in your home country, but this should not be confused with a refugee application.

## Required Form for Asylum Seekers: I-589

The most important document for an asylum application is **Form I-589**, a critical application form used to request asylum in the U.S. and to prevent removal (deportation).

## Who Can Apply?

* Individuals who have faced persecution or are under oppression in their home country. 
* Applicants who have entered the United States within the past one year.

## Disqualifying Factors

In general, individuals who have committed serious crimes, engaged in terrorist activities, or resided safely in another country without seeking asylum are not eligible to apply.

## Cost

There is no filing fee for this application.

## Where to Submit Form I-589

While it is possible to mail your I-589 form, we strongly recommend the online submission option, which is significantly easier and more efficient.

[If mailing is more suitable for you, here is the link to Form I-589 and the mailing addresses.](https://www.dhs.gov/now-leaving?external_url=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDQsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzY2lzLmdvdi9pLTU4OSIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzA5MDcuODIyMjIzMTEifQ.aBPA6aM59dqYfIKvblgci1L1htEmr-otpk4fCFfgWcY%2Fs%2F2463955272%2Fbr%2F225425019665-l&back_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dhs.gov%2Farchive%2Fnews%2F2023%2F09%2F07%2Fwhere-submit-your-form-i-589)

With the digitalization of asylum applications, you can now easily track the status of your case, send secure messages to USCIS, and respond to evidence requests directly through your online account.

## How to Complete Form I-589

Form I-589, used in the U.S. asylum process, is detailed and requires careful attention. In addition to personal information, you must provide a comprehensive, well-documented statement describing the persecution or fear of persecution you experienced in your home country. Supporting documents such as your passport, extensive country reports, witness testimonies of chronic threats or attacks, and identity documents are crucial to strengthen your application.

Submitting false or incomplete information is one of the most common mistakes and can result in negative outcomes. To avoid this, it is best to complete the form with the guidance of an experienced immigration attorney who can ensure the process is handled correctly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **I am currently in the U.S. without legal status. Can I still apply for asylum using Form I-589?**

Yes! Regardless of your status, you can apply for asylum. However, you must file the form within one year of your entry into the U.S. 

### **How long does USCIS take to make a decision?**

Processing times for Form I-589 vary by year. For example, similar applications such as Form I-539 (Extension of Nonimmigrant Status) had average processing times as follows: 

\-2018: approximately 3.4 months 

\-2019: approximately 4.4 months 

\-In later years, times ranged from 4.8 to 9.6 months, with averages of 6.8 to 5.9 months. 

 However, asylum cases typically take much longer than these examples. 

### **Can I work in the U.S. while my asylum application is pending?**

Depending on your situation, you may be eligible to apply for a work permit 150 days after submitting your asylum application, which would allow you to work legally.
