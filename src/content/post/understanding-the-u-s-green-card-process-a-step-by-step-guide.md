**Understanding the U.S. Green Card Process: A Step-by-Step Guide**\
Obtaining a U.S. Green Card — the official proof of lawful permanent residency — is a major step toward building your life in the United States. Whether your goal is to live, work, reunite with family, or eventually become a U.S. citizen, understanding the process is essential to your success. At Capitol Law Partners, our immigration attorneys guide clients through every stage with precision and care.


**Step 1**: Determine Your Eligibility Green Cards can be obtained through multiple pathways, including: 

* Family Sponsorship: Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
* Employment-Based Categories: Skilled workers, professionals, investors, and other special categories. 
* Diversity Visa Lottery: For applicants from countries with low U.S. immigration rates. 

*  Special Categories: Refugees, asylees, and other humanitarian programs. Our attorneys assess your situation to identify the most effective route for your application.

**Step 2**: File the Appropriate Petition The process usually begins with a petition filed by a sponsoring family member or employer (Form I-130 or I-140). In some cases, you may self-petition. We ensure your petition is complete, accurate, and filed with the correct supporting documentation.

**Step 3:** Wait for Visa Availability Some categories require waiting for a visa number to become available, based on the U.S. Department of State’s Visa Bulletin. We monitor your case closely to avoid unnecessary delays.

**Step 4:** Submit Your Green Card Application If you are in the U.S., you will file Form I-485 for adjustment of status. If you are abroad, you will go through consular processing. Capitol Law Partners handles both processes seamlessly, preparing you for every interview and document request.

**Step 5:** Attend Biometrics and Interviews Biometrics appointments and interviews are key stages. We help you prepare for the questions, gather required evidence, and address any issues that arise.

**Step 6:** Receive Your Green Card Once approved, you will receive your Green Card in the mail. We also advise on your rights and responsibilities as a permanent resident, including steps toward eventual citizenship.
